     Hi Everyone. My name is Jonathan Shelly and I have been teaching Pre-K through two general music and choir in Connecticut for the past eight years. I also have taught middle and  high school band, orchestra, and choir. My musical background includes jazz studies and arranging, as well as trombone performance. I donâ€™t have any previous web development experience from an HTML perspective. I currently teach virtually about one-third of the time and plan on using this course as another means to enhance my ability to do so. Children are learning online in self-directed ways more so than ever and I plan on using the skills gained in this course to facilitate instrumental instruction at home as  a supplement to what they are doing in the classroom. I plan on using my second-grade ukulele class as a pilot.
