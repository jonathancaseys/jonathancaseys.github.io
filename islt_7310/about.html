            I have taught elementary general music and choir for 8 years in Windsor, Connecticut. I have previously taught band and orchestra from elementary to high school 
            levels. My undergraduate degree was in jazz trombone, but I also play funk, rock, R&B, soul, bluegrass, and traditional Irish music.
            I also teach elementary ukulele and have a certification in Level 1 Modern Band. I believe the ukulele is the perfect instrument to engage young students 
            in musical collaboration, songwriting, and improvisation. Outside of playing and teaching music, I love to forage and cook wild food, as well as 
            garden. I am also a student of culinary history and learning about culture through food. One of my favorite things is to make cultural connections through 
            food, history, and the arts. One of my favorite topics to teach is sound production and the physics of music. I have found that teaching how instruments and 
            sound works is a wonderful way to engage students in learning about music.</p> <br>
