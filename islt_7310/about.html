        <h1>Jonathan Shelly</h1>    
        <h3>Here is a little bit of background on who I am.</h3>
<p>I have taught elementary general music and choir for 8 years in Windsor, Connecticut. I have previously taught band and orchestra from elementary to high school levels. My undergraduate degree was in <strong>jazz trombone,</strong> but I also play funk, rock, R&B, soul, bluegrass, and traditional Irish music.<br/>
    I also teach elementary ukulele and have a certification in Level 1 Modern Band. I believe the <em>ukulele</em> is the perfect instrument to engage young students in musical collaboration, songwriting, and <em>improvisation</em>. Outside of playing and teaching music, I love to forage and cook wild food, as well as garden. I am also a student of culinary history and learning about culture through food. One of my favorite things is to make cultural connections through food, history, and the arts. One of my favorite topics to teach is sound production and the physics of music. I have found that teaching how instruments and sound works is a wonderful way to engage students in learning about music.</p>
