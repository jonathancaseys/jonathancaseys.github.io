        <h3>Welcome to Mr. Shelly’s Exploration of Sound Website!</h3>  
        <p>Through this web page, students will learn the basics of how sound works. 
        We will explore the basics of strings as a means of demonstrating this. We will learn how these things affect the basic function and design of instruments. 
        Students will also engage in experiments that show us how these principles of sound work. In addition to all of this, we will explore cymatics, 
        or the visualization of sound. We will see how sound can be visualized through water, magnetic liquids, electricity, and even fire. 
        All of these things will help us understand how sound functions and moves through our environment. The goal of this site is to create fun, 
        engaging and interactive ways to help us better understand how sound and science interact with each other.</p>
