            <h1 class="title">Let's Learn about Sound: Vibration</h1>
            <p class="text">When we talk about sound vibrations, its usually something that we feel or hear. It is not
                often
                something that we can see.
                Whether its the strike of a snare drum or the strum of the strings of a guitar, usually what we can
                see is blurry movement,
                but not individual vibrations. In the clip to the left, the band Metallica teams up with a video
                crew to record slow motion
                video of their perfomance, including drums, bass, piano, and guitar. <br> <br>
                Here, the video crew is using close-up footage using high-speed cameras with an extrememly high
                framerate to capture individual vibrations
                that we can now see with the naked eye! <br> <br>
                In the second clip, I have created some of these same effects using a smartphone and some simple
                instruments. I first use my camera to record
                a tuning fork being dipped into water, and then I record my ukulele strings being strummed.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Let's Learn about Sound: Properties of Strings</h1>
            <p class="text">It can be common for young students to associate small instruments with "low" sounds, and
                large
                instruments with "high" sounds,
                simply because sometimes we associate low with small and high with big. But if we know any basics
                about the properties of strings,
                then we can learn a little bit about the relationship between the qualities of a string and its
                pitch. <br><br>
                In the infographic I have created to the left, we can see a graphic representation of a "standing
                wave", or the type of sound wave
                created by a string instrument. We can see that it moves back and forth, shaking widely at some
                points and narrowly at others.
                The next image shows a zoomed in ukuele, where we can see the vibrations but not specifically the
                back and forth motion that we
                saw in the first lesson with the slow-motion camera. <br>
                So why do some instruments make higher sounds and other instruments lower sounds? It heavily depends
                on the length of the strings.
                A long instrument, like the string bass in the picture, makes very low sounds, while the violin,
                with its short strings, makes very high sounds.
                <br> And then we have instruments that make both high and low sounds, like the autoharp in the
                bottom left.

            <h1 class="title">Cymatics: Visualization of Sound</h1>
            <p class="text">Students will gain a better understanding of the properties of sound waves through the use
                of
                cymatics,
                or visualizations of sound. This can be done through various mediums, such as chladni plates, water,
                magnetic liquids, fire, and electricity.
                In the case of a chladni plate, for example, a steel plate is connected to a tone generator. By
                covering the plate with sand or salt,
                the experimenter adjusts the tone generator until a resonant frequency is found. When this happens,
                the particles will form geometric patterns
                on the plate, as seen in this image to the left. The more complex the pattern, the higher the pitch,
                and the less complex, the lower the pitch.
                Watch this video here to see how cymatic patterns are used to show the properties of sound waves.</p>
